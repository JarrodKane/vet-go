# Paws Connect API


## Project Overview

The Paws Connect API is built using FastAPI and PostgreSQL. It provides a backend solution for an app that allows users to take care of and monitor their animals. The project is currently in the MVP stage.
I started this app off by cloning and using this template [GitHub](https://github.com/rafsaf/minimal-fastapi-postgres-template). I used this as I wanted to get a good starting point for this project.
